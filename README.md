# Lake

Custom `rc.lua` for Awesome WM, written with plugins in mind. Making the Awesome truly awesome.


## The Idea

Managing widgets in Awesome is a pain in the ass. It looks like "take this code, open your `rc.lua`, write some `require()` here, add this line here, create the widget, store it to some variable, then add it to some container, then define some hotkeys here and here and some timers here". Sometimes it feels like a bit too much friction, doesn't it?

Thankfully, Lake comes and saves your day by putting some auto-management on this stuff. You just put the plugin in `~/.config/awesome`, and voila! Widget appears in the right place, hotkeys, mouse bindings and other stuff work just as you might expect.


## So, how do I start?

Replace your old `rc.lua` with this brand new `lake.lua`, probably renaming it in the process. After that, fill your config folder with some nice plugins or write your own.

Lake will attempt to load every file that starts with `lake-`. Plugins are loaded in alphabetical order so you can control loading order and widget positions by renaming corresponding files.


## API documentation

Here's the template for you plugin:

```lua
return function(lake)
	-- your code goes here
end
```

You interact with the rest of the world through the `lake` object.


### lake.ask(lib)

Use this instead of `require()`. You will also need this for accessing standard objects, such as `awesome` and `mouse`.


### lake.set_var(name, value)

Set lake variable. This variable will be globally visible.


### lake.get_var(name)

Get lake variable. These variables are globally visible.

Lake itself uses some vars as well:

* **sloppy_focus** (default: **true**) &mdash; if true, make windows active on hover;
* **titlebars** (default: **false**) &mdash; if true, show titlebar above every window;
* **panel_position** (default: **"top"**) &mdash; panel position;
* **modkey** (default: **"Mod4"**) &mdash; well, modkey;
* **terminal** (default: **"xterm"**), **editor** (default: **$EDITOR or "nano"**) &mdash; commandlines for standard programs.


### lake.screens()

Returns the number of available screens. Typical usage:

```lua
-- Create one taglist widget for every screen
for s = 1, lake.screens() do
	mytaglist[s] = awful.widget.taglist(s, awful.widget.taglist.filter.all, mytaglist.buttons)
	lake.add_to_left(mytaglist[s], s)
end
```


### lake.add_to_left(widget), lake.add_to_middle(widget), lake.add_to_right(widget)

Add widget to left, middle or right section of the panel.


### lake.override_left(widget), lake.override_middle(widget), lake.override_right(widget)

Override left, middle or right section of the panel with the given widget. This will delete every widget from the section and prevent adding new ones.


### lake.global_key(key), lake.global_button(btn), lake.client_key(key), lake.client_button(btn)

Register a hotkey or button globally or for every window (making it window-specific).


### lake.rule(rule)

Register a rule.
