# Lake

Custom `rc.lua` for Awesome WM, written with plugins in mind. Making the Awesome truly awesome.

**Heads up!** This stuff is still work-in-progress and sorta incomplete.


## The Idea

Managing widgets in Awesome is a pain in the ass. It looks like "take this code, open your `rc.lua`, write some `require()` here, add this line here, create the widget, store it to some variable, then add it to some container, then define some hotkeys here and here and some timers here". Sometimes it feels like a bit too much friction, doesn't it?

Thankfully, Lake comes and saves your day by putting some auto-management on this stuff. You just put the plugin in `~/.config/awesome`, and voila! Widget appears in the right place, hotkeys, mouse bindings and other stuff work just as you might expect.


## So, how do I start?

Replace your old `rc.lua` with this brand new `lake.lua`, probably renaming it in the process. After that, fill your config folder with some nice plugins or write your own.
